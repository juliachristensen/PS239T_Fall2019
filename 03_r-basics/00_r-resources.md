# Resources for R 

## The Internet 

When you have a problem, google it! Pay special attention to any StackOverflow links in the search results. 

> *Tip:* before googling, figure out if you are using a tidyverse package like dplyr. If so, include the name of the package in your google search. For example, if you can't figure out how to add a variable to a dataframe, search "R add variable dataframe dplyr" or "R add variable dataframe tidyverse". 

### Miminal reproducible example 

Chances are you're going to use StackOverFlow a lot to solve a pressing problem you face. However, other can't understand/be interested in your problem unless you can provide an example which they can understand with minimal efforts. Such example is called a minimal reproducible example. 

Read [this StackOverFlow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example) to understand the concept and best practices.

Simply put, a MRE consists of the following items:

- A minimal dataset 
- the minimal burnable code
- the necessary information on package, R version, system (use sessionInfo())
- (for random process) a seed for reproducibility (set.seed())

## Vignettes

Per [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/help.html):

> Many packages include vignettes, which are discursive documents meant to illustrate and explain facilities in the package. You can discover vignettes by accessing the help page for a package, or via the browseVignettes() function: the command browseVignettes() opens a list of vignettes from all of your installed packages in your browser, while browseVignettes(package=package-name) (e.g., browseVignettes(package="survival")) shows the vignettes, if any, for a particular package. vignette() is employed similarly, but displays a list of vignettes in text form.
> 
> You can also use the vignette("vignette-name") command to view a vignette (possibly specifying the name of the package in which the vignette resides, if the vignette name is not unique): for example, vignette("timedep") or vignette("timedep", package="survival") (which are, in this case, equivalent).
> 
> Vignettes may also be accessed from the CRAN page for the package (e.g. survival), if you wish to review the vignette for a package prior to installing and/or using it.
> 
> Packages may also include extended code demonstrations (“demos”). The command demo() lists all demos for all packages in your library, while demo(package="package-name") (e.g., demo(package="stats")) lists demos in a particular package. To run a demo, call the demo() function with the quoted name of the demo (e.g., demo("nlm")), specifying the name of the package if the name of the demo isn’t unique (e.g., demo("nlm", package="stats"), where, in this case, the package name need not be given explicitly).

* [dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html)



## Cheat Sheets 

RStudio produces and publishes 'cheat sheets' covering a wide variety of subjects. The full set can be found [here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) (see also the RStudio GitHub page [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets)).

Some useful ones include:

## (Free) Interactive Tutorials 

RStudio has also started publishing [interactive tutorials](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers). These tutorials are similar to the ones that you've been assigned in DataCamp, but they will remain available to you after the end of this semester. 

`swirl` is a package that turns the R console into an interactive learning environment. More information can be found on the [swirl website](https://swirlstats.com/).

### RMarkdown

### Markdown 

Most of the text outside of code chunks in RMarkdown documents uses markdown syntax. More information about markdown can be found [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 

For help with markdown syntax, see [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

To create a markdown document like this one, just open a text editor (i.e. Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on a Mac) and add '.md' at the end of your file name. 

### LaTeX 

To write equations in an RMarkdown document, you can use LaTeX syntax. However, note that this feature tends to be buggy.

Useful links: 
* [Detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html): looks up LaTeX command that matches a shape that you have drawn using your mouse. 
* [List of LaTeX mathematical symbols](https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols): good reference if you detexify doesn't find the symbol that you want 
* [https://mathpix.com/](https://mathpix.com/): generates LaTeX code based on pictures of equations from class notes, textbook, etc.
