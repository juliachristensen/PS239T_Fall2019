Empire; and all the vigour that was drained from it was received by the Goths.  I conclude, then, that any principality that does not have its own army cannot be secure; rather, it must rely completely on luck or the favour of others, because it lacks the strength to defend itself  in difficult times.  Wise men have always thought and held 'quod nihil sit tam infirmum aut instabile quam fama potentiae non sua vi nixa'. And one's own forces are those composed of subjects or citizens or of one's dependents; all the others are either mercenaries or auxiliaries. The right way to organise one's forces will be easily grasped, if the methods used by the four men I have cited above are examined, and if it is understood how Philip, father of Alexander the Great, and many other republics and rulers have armed and organised their states; I have complete faith in their methods.
