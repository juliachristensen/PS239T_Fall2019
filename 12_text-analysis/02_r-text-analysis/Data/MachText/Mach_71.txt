watch these nobles very carefully, and fear them as much as if they were declared enemies, because if he finds himselfin trouble they will always do their best to bring him down.  A man who becomes ruler through popular favour, then, must keep the people well disposed towards him. This will be easy, since they wÂ·ant only not to be oppressed. But a man who becomes ruler against the wishes of the people, and through the favour of the nobles, must above all else try to win over the people, which will be easy if you protect them. And if men are well treated by those from whom they expected ill-treatment, they become more attached to their benefactor; the people will at once become better disposed towards him than if he had attained power through their favour. A ruler can win over the people in many ways; but because these vary so much according to the circumstances one cannot give any definite rules, and I shall therefore leave this matter on one side. I shall affirm only that it is necessary for a ruler to have the people well disposed towards him; otherwise, in difficult times he will find himself in desperate straits.
