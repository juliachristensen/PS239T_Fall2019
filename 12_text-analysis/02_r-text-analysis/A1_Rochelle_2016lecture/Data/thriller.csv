you make it.You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,.You're paralyzed.'Cause this is thriller, thriller night.And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike.You know it's thriller, thriller night.You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight.You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run.You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun.You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination.But all the while you hear the creature creepin'up behind.You're out of time.'Cause this is thriller, thriller night.There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes.You know it's thriller, thriller night.You're fighting to survive inside a killer, thriller tonight.Night creatures call.And the dead start to walk in their masquerade.There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time they're open wide.This is the end of your life.They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side.They will possess you unless you change the number on your dial.Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together.All thru the night I'll save you from the terrors on the screen,.I'll make you see.That it's a thriller, thriller night.'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare to try.Girl, this is thriller, thriller night.So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller.Thriller here tonight.Darkness falls across the land.The midnite hour is close at hand.Creatures crawl in search of blood.To terrorize y'awl's neighbourhood.And whosoever shall be found.Without the soul for getting down.Must stand and face the hounds of hell.And rot inside a corpse's shell.The foulest stench is in the air.The funk of forty thousand years.And grizzly ghouls from every tomb.Are closing in to seal your doom.And though you fight to stay alive.Your body starts to shiver.For no mere mortal can resist.The evil of the thriller.Can you dig it?!."Beat It,"They told him, ""Don't you ever come around here..Don't wanna see your face. You better disappear."".The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear.So beat it, just beat it.You better run, you better do what you can.Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man.You wanna be tough, better do what you can.So beat it, but you wanna be bad.Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it.No one wants to be defeated.Showin' how funky strong is your fight.It doesn't matter who's wrong or right.Just beat it, beat it.They're out to get you, better leave while you can.Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man.You wanna stay alive, better do what you can.So beat it, just beat it.You have to show them that you're really not scared.You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare.They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair.So beat it, but you wanna be bad.Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it.No one wants to be defeated.Showin' how funky strong is your fight.It doesn't matter who's wrong or right.Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it.Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it.No one wants to be defeated.Showin' how funky strong is your fight.It doesn't matter who's wrong or right.Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it.No one wants to be defeated.Showin' how funky strong is your fight.It doesn't matter who's wrong or right.Just beat it, beat it.Beat it, beat it, beat it."Billie Jean,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene.I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one.Who will dance on the floor in the round.She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round.She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene.Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one.Who will dance on the floor in the round.People always told me be careful of what you do.And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts.And mother always told me be careful of who you love.And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth.Billie Jean is not my lover.She's just a girl who claims that I am the one.But the kid is not my son.She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son.For forty days and forty nights.The law was on her side.But who can stand when she's in demand.Her schemes and plans.'cause we danced on the floor in the round.So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice.do think twice..She told my baby we'd danced 'til three.Then she looked at me.She showed a photo of a baby crying.His eyes looked like mine.Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby.People always told me be careful of what you do.And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts.She came and stood right by me.Then the smell of sweet perfume.This happened much too soon.She called me to her room.Billie Jean is not my lover.She's just a girl who claims that I am the one.But the kid is not my son.Billie Jean is not my lover.She's just a girl who claims that I am the one.But the kid is not my son.She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son.She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son.Billie Jean is not my lover.She's just a girl who claims that I am the one.But the kid is not my son.She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son.She says I am the one, she says he is my son.She says I am the one.Billie Jean is not my lover.Billie Jean is not my lover.Billie Jean is not my lover.Billie Jean is not my lover.Billie Jean is not my lover.Billie Jean is not my lover."Human Nature,"Looking Out.Across The Night-Time.The City Winks A Sleepless Eye.Hear Her Voice.Shake My Window.Sweet Seducing Sighs.Get Me Out.Into The Night-Time.Four Walls Won't Hold Me Tonight.If This Town.Is Just An Apple.Then Let Me Take A Bite.If They Say -.Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature.Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way.If They Say -.Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature.Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way.Reaching Out.To Touch A Stranger.Electric Eyes Are Ev'rywhere.See That Girl.She Knows I'm Watching.She Likes The Way I Stare.If They Say -.Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature.Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way.If They Say -.Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature.Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way.I Like Livin' This Way.I Like Lovin' This Way.Looking Out.Across The Morning.The City's Heart Begins To Beat.Reaching Out.I Touch Her Shoulder.I'm Dreaming Of The Street.If They Say -.Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature.Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way.If They Say -.Why, Why, Tell 'Em That Is Human Nature.Why, Why, Does He Do Me That Way.I Like Livin' This Way."PYT (Pretty Young Thing),"Where Did You Come From Lady.And Ooh Won't You Take Me There.Right Away Won't You

laughing.I'm from a world.Of disappointments and confusions.But I want her to be mine.I started talking.She kept on walking.She disappeared into the crowd.I lost my heart.On the carousel.To a circus girl.Who left my heart in pieces.Lost my heart.On The carousel.To a circus girl.Who ran away.I was the clown.And she was the dancer.We both knew it wouldn't work.But we took our chances.What I can't recall.Is if there was a girl at all.Or was it my imagination?I still remember.All of those faces.And now all I have is memories.I lost my heart.On the carousel.To a circus girl.Who left my heart in pieces.Lost my heart.On The carousel.To a circus girl.Who ran away.Two different people.In love for an instant.To see that the circus came today.Sometimes I can hear the calliope.And I can hear her calling me.Don't you know?I lost my heart.On the carousel.To a circus girl.Who left my heart in pieces.Lost my heart.On The carousel.To a circus girl.Who ran away."
