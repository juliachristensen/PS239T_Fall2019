administering provinces, as the armies of the Roman Empire did. Hence, if it was then more necessary to satisfy the soldiers than the people, it was because the soldiers were more powerful.  Nowadays, for all rulers, except the Sultans of Turkey and Egypt, it is more necessary to satisfy the people than the soldiers, because the people are now more powerful. The Sultan of Turkey is an exception because he always keeps twelve thousand foot-soldiers and fifteen thousand cavalry in his service near him, and the security and strength of his Kingdom depends on these forces. Hence, he must keep these forces friendly, and pay more regard to them than to others. Likewise, since the Kingdom of the Sultan of Egypt is completely in the hands of the soldiers, he too is obliged to keep them friendly, without considering what the people may want. Moreover, it should be noted that this Sultan's state is different from every other principality.  It resembles the Papacy (which cannot be called either an hereditary principality or a new principality): for it is not the sons of the old ruler who are the heirs, and then become rulers, but the man who is elected to that position by those who are authorised. Since this institution is ancient, it cannot be called a new principality, for it lacks all the problems encountered in new principalities. Although its ruler is certainly new, the institutions of the state are old, and are ready to receive him as if he were an hereditary ruler.
