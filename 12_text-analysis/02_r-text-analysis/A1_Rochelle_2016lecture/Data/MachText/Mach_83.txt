Church already powerful, possessing all the Romagna, the Roman barons reduced to impotence, and their factions destroyed b:y the strong measures of Alexander. Moreover, Julius had opportunities for accumulating money never used before Alexander's time/julius not only followed these policies, he intensified them. He planned to capture Bologna, to destroy the power of Venice, and to expel the French from Italy. All these enterprises were successful, and it was very much to his credit that he did everything in order to increase the power of the Church, and not any individual. He kept the Orsini and Colonna factions in the same impotent condition in which he found them; and although they had some leaders capable of causing trouble, two factors militated against it. The first was the great power of the Church, which overawed them; the second was that there were no cardinals to lead either faction, the cause of the rivalries between them. These factions will always cause trouble whenever they have cardinals as leaders, because it is they who foster these factions, inside Rome and outside, and those barons are compelled to support their own factions. Thus, the ambition of prelates is at the root of the quarrels and tumults among the barons.
