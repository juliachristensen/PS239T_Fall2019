encourage hostile forces cunningly, so that when he crushes them his reputation and power will be greatly increased.  Rulers (especially new rulers) have often found that men whom they had regarded with suspicion in the early stages of their rule prove more reliable and useful than those whom they had trusted at first. Pandolfo Petrucci, ruler of Siena, governed his state more with the help of those men of whom he had been suspicious than with anyone else. But it is very difficult to generalise about this, since men and circumstances vary. I shall say only that a ruler will always find it very easy to win over those men who were hostile to him in the early stages of his regime, but who were insufficiently powerful to maintain their position without help. For their part, they are constrained to serve him faithfully, because they are well aware how necessary it is for them to act in such a way as to cancel his initially unfavourable view of them. Thus, he will always find them more useful than those who, because they feel very secure in their positions, tend to neglect his affairs.
