they would always have prevented the other powers from intervening in Lombardy; they would never have permitted intervention if they were not to become masters of Lombardy themselves. And the other powers would not have wanted to take Lombardy from the King of France in order to give it to the Venetians, and they would not have had the strength to fight against both France and Venice. If anyone should urge that Louis ceded the Romagna to Alexander, and the Kingdom ofNaples to the King of Spain, in order to avoid waging war, I should reply with the arguments advanced before: that one should never permit troubles to develop in order to avoid having to fight a war; because it is never in fact' avoided but only postponed to your detriment. And if others should cite the promise the King made to the Pope (to undertake that campaign for him in return for the annulling of his marriage and making Rouen a cardinal), I would reply with arguments I shall advance later about how rulers should keep their promises.
